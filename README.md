# 🏏 IPL Score Prediction Using Deep Learning

This project leverages Deep Learning techniques to predict IPL scores in real time, using Python-based data analysis and modeling tools. The aim is to deliver accurate score forecasts that can assist fans, analysts, and teams during live matches.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Cricket matches are dynamic, and every ball can shift the momentum. Predicting scores as the match progresses is crucial for strategic decisions and viewer engagement. This project uses historical IPL data and deep learning models to forecast match scores with high accuracy.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
- **Data Handling**: Using NumPy and Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover match trends and patterns.
- **Modeling**: Deep learning model built with Keras (LSTM), supplemented by baseline models using Scikit-learn.
- **Deployment**: Interface developed in Streamlit/Flask for real-time score display; hosted via Heroku/AWS.

## 🧠 System Approach
- Jupyter Notebook as development environment
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Time-series prediction using LSTM
- Evaluation via MAE, RMSE, and R² metrics

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Extend to other formats like ODI and T20 World Cup  
- Predict individual player performances  
- Develop strategic simulation tools and AR-enabled live match analysis
